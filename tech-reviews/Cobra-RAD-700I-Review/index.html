    <h2>Cobra RAD 700I Radar Detector Review.</h2>
     <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>I bought the Cobra RAD 700i because I wanted something that would tell me when I was about to get a ticket, and I didn't want to drop half a grand on a Valentine One Gen 2. I'm not reviewing this as a lab test — this is based on real-world, drive-it-like-you-stole-it usage.</p>

    <h2>The Good</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>It works.</strong> I've been saved more than once already — mostly from Ka band, which it catches like a champ.</li>
      <li><strong>Built-in GPS.</strong> No extra app needed to log false alerts — it just learns where the local Walgreens automatic doors are and shuts up after a few passes. That's civilized.</li>
      <li><strong>Cloud-based updates.</strong> It connects to your phone and updates from the cloud. Fancy. Too fancy? Maybe. But it means shared threat data on the fly, and that's actually useful.</li>
      <li><strong>Voice alerts that don't sound like a 2004 TomTom.</strong> They're chill. They don't scream at you like some older detectors.</li>
      <li><strong>Compact.</strong> It doesn't look like a police scanner from 1996 sitting on your dash.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Not-So-Good</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>X Band? Still?</strong> Who's still using X band in 2025? Okay, maybe rural Indiana. But still. It should be off by default. I disable it immediately.</li>
      <li><strong>App dependency.</strong> It works on its own, but all the cool features need the Cobra app. I'd rather it just have an SD card and be done with it.</li>
      <li><strong>Mount feels cheap.</strong> It sticks, but it doesn't feel like it'll survive an Indiana summer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real-World Use</h2>
    <p>I've used it on highways, in towns, and on those empty stretches of road where the speed limit feels more like a suggestion. It consistently picks up Ka band far enough out to slow down, and I've even had a few laser detections — which is more of a “you're already caught” notification, but hey, it's honest.</p>

    <p>The cloud stuff is cool in theory, but what matters most is that it's quiet when it should be quiet and loud when it needs to be. That's what separates the good ones from the junk. And this one? It's good.</p>

    <h2>Should You Get One?</h2>
    <p>If you want a radar detector that works without costing as much as your camera lens, the RAD 700i is a solid pick. It's not invincible, but it's way better than nothing, and it's smarter than it looks. I'd trust it on a long trip, and that says something.</p>

    <p>Just do yourself a favour and turn off X band.</p>

    <p>This site is 100% real-world use. I write about what I actually shoot. No corporate sponsors, no fluff.</p>
