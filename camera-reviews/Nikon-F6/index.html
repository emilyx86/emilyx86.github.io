    <h2>Nikon F6</h2>
     <h2>The End of the Line</h2>
    <p>The Nikon F6 is the final F-series film SLR. The end of an era. Nikon's love letter to everything that made 35mm great. And honestly? It's perfect. I shoot with one every day, and I still find myself smiling when the shutter fires — crisp, confident, mechanical. It's a camera that means business, but also makes you feel something. Which no digital body ever has.</p>

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Released in 2004 — yes, during the DSLR boom — the F6 wasn't built because the world needed it. It was built because <em>Nikon wanted to prove they still could</em>. It was engineered for pros who weren't ready to let go of film. And even today, in 2025, it's the best 35mm camera I've ever touched. Bar none.</p>

    <h2>What I Love</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Metering & Exposure:</strong> The best in any film SLR. Matrix metering that rivals your digital Z camera. Custom functions. True ISO overrides. Dead-on accuracy, every frame.</li>
      <li><strong>Autofocus:</strong> Fast. Quiet. Surprisingly modern. It'll track subjects and snap into focus faster than most people's mirrorless rigs.</li>
      <li><strong>Build Quality:</strong> Feels like a brick, but in the best way. Magnesium alloy body. Sealed tighter than your tax returns. Zero flex. Survives anything. I'd trust it in a war zone or a wedding.</li>
      <li><strong>Ergonomics:</strong> The grip is perfect. The buttons make sense. The menus are clean. Everything is tactile, logical, and satisfying. No “touchscreen gimmicks” here — just pure photographer-first design.</li>
      <li><strong>DX Code Override:</strong> Want to shoot Portra 800 at 640 (because of course you do)? Just dial it in. No hacks. No sticky notes. Just professional control.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Grip Situation (MB-40)</h2>
    <p>I used to shoot mine with the MB-40. Then I got the MS-41 and realized what I was missing. Without the grip, the F6 becomes a sleek, elegant street machine. With the grip, it's a beast of a portrait camera. You can shoot either way — and that modularity is rare and beautiful. Even if the accessories are overpriced and hard to find (looking at you, $300 battery tray).</p>

    <h2>The Film Era's Mic Drop</h2>
    <p>This isn't a nostalgia camera. It's not like picking up a Canon AE-1 and going, “Wow, they made things so simple back then.” No. The F6 is from the other end of the curve — the peak. It's when Nikon had over 50 years of F-mount tech and poured all of it into one final, uncompromising machine. This is what film looked like right before it died.</p>

    <h2>Drawbacks?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>It's heavy. But that weight is security.</li>
      <li>It's electronic. If the board dies, there's no manual override. But I'll take that risk.</li>
      <li>It's expensive. And it's only getting worse. But if you're reading this, you're probably already in deep.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Word</h2>
    <p>The Nikon F6 is not for beginners. It's not for trend-chasers. It's not for Instagram. It's for people who <strong>still believe in photography as a physical, deliberate act</strong>. I shoot mine weekly. Sometimes daily. And every time I load a new roll, I'm reminded that this camera wasn't built for the market. It was built for us.</p>
